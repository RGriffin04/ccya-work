Destinations
Destinations is a site used to plan future trips
the project brief I chose was travel bucket list site, the website I wanted to make had a first person view, so instead of a login button I had the person already signed in so you could just go straight to the travel plans they had already made for the future and also so you could add more, I used HTML,CSS and Javascript to make it

I used ,the .queryselector command, .appendchild command and also the .preventdefault command - the first one returns the first element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selector. The second one gives a node to a list of children and moves them from their current position to their new position. The third one tells the user agent that if the event doesn't get handled then its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.

I planned my app by just thinking of what I wanted it to look like, so I first drew out wireframes of the general ideas I had for it and then I thought of the colours I would like it to have on it, and then once i started to actually make it, any idea i liked enough i tried to include on the site.

for SEO principles I made sure my pages were stable and didn't shake while you were on it by not overloading them with too much information, I made sure all my links were working by testing them numerous times, I gave my project pages clear names so they aren't confusing and I used the right header names on both sides of the project and made sure they were correct by seeing if they sat right on my page

for UX principles I made sure my site was simple but provided the relevant information, I also made sure the colours were clear and you could tell what was written, all of my images had descriptive alt descriptions, I implemented clear photos, I used two different fonts and both of them are clear, i also underlined important words or headers so the reader will see them better
